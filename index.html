          <strong>UnityFast</strong> is a dedication to the humans of Palestine,
          from humans across the globe. Our solidarity knows no borders and no
          bounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginning on March 11th (the first day of Ramadan, a much-awaited and
          blessed month in the Muslim lunar calendar),
          <strong>UnityFast</strong> will launch a 30-day vigil to honor the
          tens of thousands of lives lost in Gaza. Together, we'll fast on their
          behalf, carrying their memories through these blessed days and beyond.
          We dedicate our sacrifices and rewards to our Palestinian brothers and
          sisters in Gaza, the West Bank, and the world over.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't have to be Muslim to observe Ramadan, and you don't have to
          fast the entire month to reap its rewards. Fast for one, two, five,
          ten or any number of days, for the many who didn't live to observe
          this month and would have savored the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ramadan is just the beginning, and fasting is the first step in our
          pledge of solidarity. Continue to
